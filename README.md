## Overview

This project was an exercise in creating an ecommerce product landing web page featuring a cart functionality that adapts to both desktop and mobile interfaces. The challenge was to implement hover states for all interactive elements, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Key skills applied in this project included the use of flexbox for layout management, TailwindCSS for styling, and ReactJS for dynamic state management and useState. The project aimed to refine my understanding of responsive design, emphasizing desktop and mobile compatibility.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a carousel gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- To be continued: View the cart and remove items from it
